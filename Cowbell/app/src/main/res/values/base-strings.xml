        Hey! Ready to wake up and train your brain? Below you\'ll find a button to add an alarm, create a set of
        multiple choice cards or a set of fill-in the blank cards. If you don\'t feel like creating a set of cards, you can
        wake up by playing our REACT minigame. You\'ll be able to select how you want to wake up at the time of setting up an alarm.
        Good luck!
