        Hey! Ready to wake up and train your brain? Below you\'ll find a button to add an alarm, create a set of
        multiple choice cards or a set of fill-in the blank cards. If you don\'t feel like creating a set of cards, you can
        wake up by playing our REACT mini-game. You\'ll be able to select how you want to wake up at the time of setting up an alarm.
        If you select any of the cards game, you\'ll have to answer a random card from the ones you save!
        Good luck!
